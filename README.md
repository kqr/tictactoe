tictactoe
=========

A simplistic tic-tac-toe game in Java with computer opponents and difficulty
setting. Made primarily because I needed to learn how handling different
game stages works with the GameState thing in Slick2D.

I've also always wanted to write a computer opponent for a tic-tac-toe game,
so I took the chance to integrate one of those. It's not the best one, it's
unreasonably slow especially for the easiest difficulty setting, but the game
is small enough that I don't think it matters. What's important is that it
actually plays the game (and rather well at that, given a higher difficulty
setting.)
